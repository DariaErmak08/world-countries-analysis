# 🌍 World Countries Data Analysis  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the demographic and geographical data of countries worldwide.  
We explore **population distribution, land area, density, and key insights** using **Python, Pandas, and Seaborn**.  

## 🔍 Key Analysis Points  
✔ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data formatting.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Filtering, grouping, and aggregating country statistics.  
✔ **Visualization**:  
   - Histogram of population distribution  
   - Scatter plot (Population vs. Land Area)  
   - Bar chart (Top 10 most populated countries)  
✔ **Key Insights**: Population density, unexpected patterns, and trends.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset contains **country names, capitals, regions, population, and land area**.

## 📌 Results & Findings  
1️⃣ **Most populated countries**: China, India, and the USA have the highest populations.  
2️⃣ **No direct link between land area and population**: Russia is the largest country but not the most populated.  
3️⃣ **High-density countries**: Monaco and Vatican City have extremely high population densities.  
4️⃣ **Unexpected results**: Some regions have a population of **zero** (uninhabited islands).  

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
